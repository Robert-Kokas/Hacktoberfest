<h1>This is my Hacktoberfest Website</h1>
<br>
<h3>Happy Hacking!!!</h3>
<br>
<p>This is a website I made simply for the purpose of attempting to fulfill the (4) PR requirement to obtain a free Hacktoberfest t-shirt. So far, I've met the requirement of submitting 4 PRs; however, I am 99% certain that my co-worker Chris Steegz is completely misinformed as to how the Hacktoberfest process is intended to work. Submitting PRs to meaningless repositories when you are the submitter and the approver makes absolutely no sense. I hope for his sake and my own, I am the one who just doesnt "get it", and I look forward to being delightfully surprised if that ends up being the case. Until then, this is Robert, signing off. Adios!</p>
